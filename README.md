# Job Tracker

A job application tracker built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.  
This project focuses on mastering React fundamentals through real-world patterns such as custom hooks, derived state, and controlled forms.

## Features
- Add, edit, and delete job applications
- Track application status (Applied, Interview, Offer, Rejected)
- Filter jobs by status
- Persistent data using localStorage
- Clean and reusable component structure

## Tech Stack
- React
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS

## Key React Concepts Applied
- Component-driven architecture
- Controlled forms
- Lifting state up
- Custom hooks (`useJobs`)
- Side effects with `useEffect`
- Derived state (filtering without duplicated state)
- Reusing components for create and edit flows

## What I Learned
- How to minimize state and derive UI from existing data
- How to separate business logic from UI using custom hooks
- How to reason about UI without side effects
- How to design scalable and maintainable React components

## Getting Started
```bash

npm run dev
